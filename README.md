# Rediche's World vs. World Marker Pack

World vs. World can be a difficult game mode to learn and this marker pack sets out to help new players get accostomed to placement of siege and additional information on why certain locations work, even though they seem like they might not.

Currently you can find siege placements for every World vs. World map, not including Edge of the Mists.

## Installation

### Blish HUD

It is recommended for you to install the marker pack directly through the pathing module in BlishHUD.

To install manually follow these steps:

1. Download the latest marker file: [RedicheWvwPack.taco](https://github.com/rediche/rediche-wvw-pack/raw/main/rediche-wvw-pack/RedicheWvwPack.taco).
2. Move the file to `C:\Users\YOUR_USERNAME\Documents\Guild Wars 2\addons\blishhud\markers`.
3. Restart BlishHUD.

### TacO

We do not recommend using this pack with TacO because the marker pack heavily relies on features that TacO does not support.
